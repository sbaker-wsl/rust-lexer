This repository contains the source code for a lexer I wrote in the Rust programming langauge.

There are additional files, meant to support the integration of a command line tool, which contain additional functionality and concepts of
programming languages.

As of right now, the command line tool supports the implementation of both a basic lexer and a theoretical grammar (rules, derivation, sentennial).
If this interests you, feel free to clone the repository and try to create your own grammar or write your own example for tokenization, suggest changes,
(add me on github and I will reply!) or identify bugs.

This is a personal project I will continue working on (extended functionality, cleaner code).
